Overview
^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: bash

    Parse sequencing_summary.txt files and .paf files to find split reads in an
    Oxford Nanopore Dataset

    General options:
      -h, --help         Show this help and exit
      -d , --distance    Specify the maximum distance between consecutive
                         mappings. This is the difference between 'Target Start'
                         and 'Target End' in the paf file. Defaults to 10000
      -t , --top         Specify how many top processed reads to display. Default
                         is 10
      -D, --debug        Write debug file

    Input sources:
      -s , --summary     A sequencing summary file generated by albacore
      -p , --paf         A paf file generated by minimap2

    Output files:
      -F , --out-fused   Specify name of the fused_read file. This file only
                         contains chains of reads. Defaults to 'fused_reads.txt'
